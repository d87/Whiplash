The Twitter handle itself in a Twitter match. If the match is '@someTwitterUser', the handle is 'someTwitterUser'.\n\t * 4. Group that matches an email address.

Ex: 'http://google.com', 'www.google.com', or just 'google.com'.\n\t *    This also includes a path, url parameters, or hash anchors. Ex: google.com/path/to/file?q1=1&q2=2#myAnchor\n\t * 6.
